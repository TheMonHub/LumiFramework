## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities in LumiFramework seriously. If you discover a security issue, we kindly request that you report it to us **privately** so we can address it responsibly before public disclosure.

**Please report vulnerabilities via email to:**

`mono15.parnthakote@gmail.com`

**Alternatively, you can report it via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature** by navigating to the "Security" tab of our GitHub repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability." [Learn more about GitHub's private reporting process](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

**When reporting, please include the following information (as much detail as possible):**

* A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (including code examples if applicable).
* The version(s) of LumiFramework affected.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Any suggested mitigations or fixes (optional).

**What to Expect After Reporting:**

* We will acknowledge receipt of your report typically within **a week or two**
* We will investigate the vulnerability promptly.
* We will keep you informed of our progress and the estimated timeline for a fix.
* We ask that you allow us a reasonable time (e.g., 30-90 days, depending on severity) to address the vulnerability before public disclosure. We will work with you on a coordinated disclosure plan.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Your cooperation in responsible disclosure is highly valued and helps keep LumiFramework secure for everyone.
