LumiFramework is a cutting-edge C++ framework that streamlines **cross-platform desktop application development**. Built from the ground up with **C++20 Modules**, Lumi provides the essential scaffolding you need to build powerful, interactive apps for **Windows, Linux, and ~~macOS~~** with unprecedented ease and speed. We cut the boilerplate so you can focus on your application's unique logic.

### Key Features & Design Philosophy

* **Engineered for Modern C++**: Embrace the future of C++ development. Lumi is built using **C++20 Modules**, which unlocks faster compile times, robust dependency management, and a cleaner codebase by design.
* **Highly Modular & Low-Coupling Architecture**: Lumi is not a monolithic framework but a **collection of independent libraries**. Designed with minimal internal dependencies, this architecture allows you to consume only the specific components you need. You can seamlessly integrate Lumiâ€™s libraries into your existing C++ project, giving you complete control over your application's structure.
* **Flexible, High-to-Low-Level Control**: Lumi adapts to your needs, not the other way around. You can harness **precise, low-level control** when you need it, or leverage powerful, ready-made components like our application loop and event handling for rapid development. This design empowers your architectural choices, fitting your unique ecosystem without restriction.
* **Robust Cross-Platform Foundations**: We've tackled the trickiest parts of cross-platform development for you. Get started quickly with robust solutions for **window management, input processing, and graphics integration**, providing a solid foundation for your app.
