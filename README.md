[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/TheMonHub/LumiFramework/graph/badge.svg?token=2YN92BA4JE)](https://codecov.io/gh/TheMonHub/LumiFramework)

LumiFramework is a C++ library designed to make building cross-platform desktop applications easier and faster. It focuses on helping developers create powerful, interactive apps for **Windows, Linux, and macOS** without getting bogged down by complex setup or repetitive code.

### What LumiFramework Offers

* **Flexible Control:** Lumi gives you the best of both worlds. You can dive deep and control low-level details, or use its built-in features like the **application loop** and **event handling** for quicker development.
* **A Library That Acts Like a Framework:** While it's a library, Lumi provides many components you'd expect from a full framework. You're free to use as much or as little of it as your project needs, fitting seamlessly into your existing C++ setup.
* **Ready-Made Foundation:** It handles the tricky parts of cross-platform development, like **window management, input, and graphics**. 
* **Highly Modular:** Lumi is built for flexibility. It is provided as a **static library**, and you can easily swap out its default parts, or integrate your own custom code and other third-party libraries. It adapts to **your application's architecture**, not the other way around.
* **Built for C++ Developers:** Lumi understands what C++ developers need. It provides the essential scaffolding while keeping you in charge of your application's unique logic and features.
