## Lumi: Empowering C++ Development for Desktop Applications

Lumi is a **modular C++ framework library** engineered to streamline the creation of **robust, high-performance, and interactive cross-platform desktop applications**. Its core mission is to bring **simplicity and significant boilerplate reduction** to common C++ project setups, freeing developers to concentrate on their unique application logic, regardless of the application domain.

Lumi achieves this by:

* **Curated Cross-Platform Foundation:** Providing robust, cross-platform abstractions for foundational elements like windowing, input, and graphics context management. Lumi wisely builds upon **preselected, battle-tested low-level libraries** (such as GLFW) and system APIs, eliminating the need for developers to research and integrate these components from scratch.
* **Exceptional Modularity & Granular Control:** Lumi's design champions **modularity and developer control**. Provided as both **static and dynamic libraries**, Lumi offers supreme flexibility in how you link it to your project, with no prescribed integration method. Unlike traditional frameworks that might dictate your application's architecture, Lumi adapts to *your* app's logic. It provides lower-level access, allowing you to easily swap out default implementations, integrate other third-party libraries, or inject your own custom solutions precisely where needed.
* **Developer-Empowering Philosophy:** While Lumi offers essential scaffolding (like an optional main application loop to simplify event handling), you remain entirely in charge of your application's unique features and core work. Lumi integrates into your C++ environment, empowering you as a C++ developer to craft your own application architecture, rendering strategies, and overall logic with **less complexity and more focus**.

### Vision & Goals

LumiFramework is born from the desire to make advanced C++ desktop application development more accessible and enjoyable without sacrificing performance or control. Our vision for LumiFramework is to be:

* **The Go-To Foundation for Desktop C++:** A trusted, reliable, and continuously evolving core for building a wide array of desktop applications, from powerful utilities to immersive interactive experiences. We are explicitly focused on **Windows, Linux, and macOS** as our primary target platforms.
* **Truly Developer-Centric:** We believe developers should spend their time solving unique problems, not fighting boilerplate or rigid framework structures. Lumi will always prioritize developer autonomy, offering powerful tools and sensible defaults that can be easily customized or bypassed.
* **A Catalyst for Innovation:** By simplifying the underlying complexities of cross-platform setup and low-level interactions, Lumi aims to empower developers to bring their unique ideas to life faster, fostering more innovation in the C++ desktop application space.
* **Modular & Extensible:** Lumi will consistently strive for maximum modularity, allowing developers to integrate their preferred libraries and custom implementations seamlessly. This means Lumi will always be a complement to your existing C++ ecosystem, not a replacement for it.

## Project Status

LumiFramework is currently in its **active development and execution phase**. Our primary focus is on building a robust and stable **core foundation** and establishing its key features.

At this time, we are **not yet accepting external contributions**. We appreciate your interest, and contribution guidelines (along with a code of conduct) will be made available once the project reaches a more mature and stable state.
