## How to Contribute: Beyond Just Code

Contributing to LumiFramework isn't just about writing code! There are many ways to help improve the project, whether you're a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out. Every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable.

### Different Ways to Contribute

#### 1\. Report Bugs and Issues

Found a bug? Encountered unexpected behavior? Your detailed reports are crucial for making LumiFramework more stable and reliable.

* **How to Report:** Please open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/TheMonHub/LumiFramework/issues/new/choose). We have templates to guide you.
* **What to Include:** Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue, what you expected to happen, what actually happened (including any error messages), and details about your environment (OS, compiler, LumiFramework version/commit).

#### 2\. Suggest New Features or Enhancements

Have an idea to make LumiFramework even better? We'd love to hear it!

* **How to Suggest:** Open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/TheMonHub/LumiFramework/issues/new/choose).
* **What to Include:** Clearly describe the problem your feature solves, propose how it might work (conceptual design, API ideas), and explain why it would be beneficial to LumiFramework and its users.

#### 3\. Improve Documentation

Good documentation is key to a framework's usability. If something is unclear, incomplete, or missing, you can help! We use Doxygen to generate our documentation.

* **How to Contribute:** This often involves submitting a [Pull Request](#10-create-a-pull-request-pr) with your proposed changes. Since we use Doxygen, documentation comments primarily live within the **source code files** themselves (e.g., `.h`/`.hpp` headers, `.cppm` interface and `.cpp` implementation files). You can also improve standalone Markdown files like `README.md` or this `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Even small typos or clarity improvements are welcome.

#### 4\. Help with Testing and Feedback

As LumiFramework evolves, rigorous testing is vital.

* **How to Contribute:** You can help by testing new features from `develop` branches, running existing examples, or simply trying to build LumiFramework on different systems and reporting any issues. Share your experiences, successes, or challenges via [GitHub Issues](#1-report-bugs-and-issues) or our [Discord server](#need-help).

#### 5\. Provide Community Support

If you're familiar with LumiFramework, you can help others!

* **How to Contribute:** Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2jJaC3yFEH) and answer questions, provide guidance, or share solutions with fellow contributors and users. Helping others learn and succeed with LumiFramework is a fantastic contribution.

#### 6\. Spread the Word

Help us grow the LumiFramework community!

* **How to Contribute:** Share LumiFramework on social media, write blog posts, create tutorials, or present it at meetups. Raising awareness helps us attract more users and contributors.

### Contributing Code (Technical Guide)

If you're ready to dive into the codebase and submit new features or bug fixes, this section is for you.

#### 1\. Fork the Repository

First, you'll need to fork the [LumiFramework repository](https://github.com/TheMonHub/LumiFramework) to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy where you can make your changes.

#### 2\. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LumiFramework.git
cd LumiFramework
````

#### 3\. Development Environment Setup

To build and contribute to LumiFramework, you will need:

  * **C++ Compiler:**
      * **Clang** (recommended): LLVM/Clang 16.0 and newer.
      * **GCC**: GCC 14 (for the in-development branch, after 2023-09-20) and newer.
      * **MSVC**: MSVC toolset 14.34 and newer (provided with Visual Studio 17.4 and newer).
  * **CMake:** Version 3.28 or newer.
  * **Git:** Latest stable version.
  * **Clang-Format & Clang-Tidy:** Ensure these are installed and in your PATH for the formatting and static analysis scripts to work correctly, LLVM version 19 required.

LumiFramework aims to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS. Please ensure your development environment is set up according to these requirements.

#### 4\. File and Naming Conventions

To maintain consistency and readability across the LumiFramework codebase, please adhere to the following conventions:

* **File Naming:** All source and header files (`.hpp`, `.cpp`, `.cppm`) should use **`snake_case`** for their names (e.g., `my_awesome_module.hpp`, `window_system.cpp`). If older files do not follow this, please update them if your changes touch them, or report an issue.

* **File Headers (Copyright & License):** Every new or modified source file must begin with the standard LumiFramework copyright and license header. Please ensure the year is current.

    ```cpp
    // Copyright (c) 2025. // Or 2023-2025 if it was first created in 2023 and updated in 2025.
    // Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0

    //
    // Created by Mono on 10/6/2025.
    // // This "Created by" line is optional and for your convenience.
    ```
  *Note: The "Created by" line is primarily for your internal tracking or IDE integration and isn't strictly required for every file in a public project, but if you want it, keep it consistent.*

* **Header Guards:** To prevent multiple inclusions, all header files (`.hpp`) must use include guards. The naming convention for these guards should follow the pattern:
  `LUMI_COMPONENT_SUB_COMPONENT_FILENAME_HPP_`

    * **Structure:** `LUMI_` (project prefix) `COMPONENT_` (major module/component, e.g., `WINDOW`, `INPUT`) `SUB_COMPONENT_` (optional sub-component, e.g., `DETAILS`, `VULKAN`) `FILENAME_` (snake_case filename) `EXTENSION_` (e.g., `HPP_`)

    * **Example for `Lumi/Window/src/window_surface.hpp`:**
        ```cpp
        #ifndef LUMI_WINDOW_WINDOW_SURFACE_HPP_
        #define LUMI_WINDOW_WINDOW_SURFACE_HPP_

        // ... file content ...

        #endif // LUMI_WINDOW_WINDOW_SURFACE_HPP_
        ```
    * **Example for `Lumi/Graphics/Vulkan/src/vulkan_device.cppm`:**
        ```cpp
        #ifndef LUMI_GRAPHICS_VULKAN_VULKAN_DEVICE_CPPM_
        #define LUMI_GRAPHICS_VULKAN_VULKAN_DEVICE_CPPM_

        // ... file content ...

        #endif // LUMI_GRAPHICS_VULKAN_VULKAN_DEVICE_CPPM_
        ```
  This convention ensures uniqueness across your project and clearly indicates the file's location within the framework structure.

#### 5\. Gitflow Workflow

LumiFramework uses the **Gitflow Workflow**. This means we primarily work with feature branches.

1.  **Sync with `develop`:** Ensure your local `develop` branch is up to date with the upstream `develop` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull upstream develop # Assuming you've set up 'upstream' remote
    ```
    If you haven't set up the `upstream` remote yet, you can do so with:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheMonHub/LumiFramework.git
    ```
2.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Based on `develop`, create a new feature branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-widget`, `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
    ```
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your bug fix or feature.

**IMPORTANT:** It is recommended to use gitflow extensions for Git to manage your branches and releases more easily. If you haven't set up gitflow yet, you can do so by following the instructions in the [gitflow documentation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

**NOTE:** For more details on the Gitflow Workflow, refer to the [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

#### 6\. Build the Project

LumiFramework uses CMake for its build system. The primary build instructions are detailed directly within the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file at the root of the project.

In short, a typical build process involves:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Refer to the top of `CMakeLists.txt` for the most accurate and up-to-date build instructions, including any specific platform requirements or configuration options.

#### 7\. Format Your Code (Crucial\!)

LumiFramework enforces strict code formatting using Clang-Format. **We adhere strictly to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).**

**Before committing**, always run the formatting script to ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines:

```bash
./clang-format-fix.sh
```

This script will automatically reformat your code in place.

To only check the formatting without making changes, you can use:

```bash
./clang-format.sh
```

#### 8\. Run Static Analysis (Important\!)

We use Clang-Tidy for static analysis to catch potential bugs and enforce coding standards. **Before committing**, run the Clang-Tidy script:

```bash
./clang-tidy.sh
```

**Note:** This script will build the project under the `build` directory as part of its execution. Review any warnings or errors reported by Clang-Tidy and address them before pushing.

To fix issues reported by Clang-Tidy automatically, you can use the `-fix` script:

```bash
./clang-tidy-fix.sh
```

#### 9\. Test Your Changes

Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality and, if applicable, add new unit tests for your feature or bug fix. Run the tests using your build system (e.g., `cmake --build . --target test` from your `build` directory).

#### 10\. Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are complete, formatted, analyzed, and tested, commit them to your feature branch. Write clear and concise commit messages.

Use a clear and concise message prefixed with a type:

  * `feat`: For new features.
  * `fix`: For bug fixes.
  * `docs`: For documentation changes.
  * `style`: For formatting or non-functional code changes.
  * `refactor`: For code refactoring.
  * `test`: For adding or modifying tests.
  * `chore`: For maintenance tasks, build process changes, etc.
  * `perf`: For performance improvements.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "feat: Add new awesome widget"
```

#### 11\. Push Your Feature Branch

Push your feature branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 12\. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Before submitting your PR, please ensure:

  * Your code is formatted (`./clang-format-fix.sh`).
  * Clang-Tidy reports no major warnings (`./clang-tidy.sh`).
  * All existing tests pass, and new tests are added for new features/fixes.
  * Your commit messages follow the Conventional Commits guidelines.
  * You have read through your changes one last time, as if you were reviewing someone else's code.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2.  GitHub will usually show a banner prompting you to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch. If not, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request."
3.  **Ensure the base branch is `develop` on the `TheMonHub/LumiFramework` repository, and the compare branch is your `feature/your-feature-name` on your fork.**
4.  Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.
      * Explain what problem it solves or what feature it adds.
      * Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`).
5.  Submit the pull request.

#### 13\. Code Review

Maintainers will review your pull request. Be prepared to:

  * Address any feedback or questions.
  * Make further commits to your branch if necessary (these will automatically update the PR).
  * Ensure all CI checks (build, format, static analysis, tests, etc.) pass on your PR.

Once your PR is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.
